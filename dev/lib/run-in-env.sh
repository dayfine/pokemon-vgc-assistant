# harness: reusable
# Run a command in the dev environment.
#
# ============================================================================
# EXAMPLE — adapt to your project's toolchain.
#
# This script ships with the agent-harness as the OCaml + Dune + Docker
# wrapper that the source project (dayfine/trading) uses. The pattern
# (in-container path vs local-docker path, with a dune-workspace check)
# is reusable; the toolchain calls (opam env, dune-workspace) are not.
#
# When porting:
# 1. Replace `eval "$(opam env)"` with your toolchain init (cargo,
#    nvm use, source venv, etc.) or remove if not needed.
# 2. Replace `dune-workspace` existence check with your project's
#    workspace root marker (Cargo.toml, package.json, pyproject.toml).
# 3. Replace TRADING_CONTAINER_NAME default with your container name.
# 4. Replace TRADING_IN_CONTAINER env-var name with your project's
#    equivalent, or rename to something generic like AGENT_HARNESS_IN_ENV.
# 5. Replace /workspaces/<PROJECT_NAME> docker-root path with your container's
#    mount point.
#
# The split between in-container (GHA / devcontainer) and local-docker
# (developer machine) is the load-bearing pattern; the rest is example.
# ============================================================================
#
# Usage:
#   dev/lib/run-in-env.sh dune build
#   dev/lib/run-in-env.sh dune runtest trading/backtest/test/
#
# Locally (default): wraps with `docker exec` into <PROJECT_NAME>-dev,
# cd's to the workspace, and sources opam env.
#
# In GHA / devcontainer: set TRADING_IN_CONTAINER=1 and the script
# runs natively (cd + opam env, no docker wrapping).
#
# Project root resolution (in-container path):
#   GHA:   ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/trading  — repo checks out at GITHUB_WORKSPACE;
#          the dune workspace root is one level deeper at trading/.
#   Local container / other: resolve relative to this script's location.
#          The script lives at <repo-root>/dev/lib/; climb two levels to reach
#          the repo root, then descend into trading/ (the dune workspace root).
#
# Both paths verify that dune-workspace exists at the resolved root and fail
# loudly if it doesn't — this catches path mismatches rather than silently
# running dune in the wrong directory.
